# ShopEZ

ShopEZ is app targeting grassroot and Suburban shopkeepers to simplify the transaction process and help them keep track of their earnings. 

The "udharii" system is a prevalent practice among these kind of shopkeepers and sometimes it becomes start for them to keep track of the transaction taking place. The run of the mill pen and paper method is tedious an often results in mistakes. In this age where a smartphone is in every hand we want to digitize this process by keeping an e khata which keeps tabs on every customer and the amounts paid by them and in the process simplifies the billing system by leveraging models like YoloV8.
